      <p>Hi..!! I'm</p>
      <h1>N.L Sri Lasya</h1>
      <h3>
        I was born in Mummidivaram, a small village in the East Godavari
        district of Andhra Pradesh. Growing up, I always dreamed of becoming
        an artist, and that dream gradually transformed into a deep passion
        for creativity. Over time, my focus shifted towards digital art, and
        now, my ambition is to pursue a career as a web designer. By combining
        my love for art with the digital realm, I aim to create meaningful,
        innovative designs that inspire and engage others.
