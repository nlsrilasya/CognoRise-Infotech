Vision:
"To secure a job with a decent package as a foundation, and then transition into a successful web and UI/UX designer, while growing my passion for art into a thriving business."

Mission:
"To develop my skills through continuous learning and practical experience, first by gaining industry exposure in my initial role, and then evolving into a designer. I will also focus on expanding my art page into a business by creating unique, high-quality work and fostering meaningful connections with my audience."
